# BlackjackProjectColter
In this project, you are creating a playable game of
[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). If you haven't played this
game ever, or in a while, grab a deck of cards and play a few games.

## Objectives

- Practice the skills and ideas you have learned so far.
- Effectively use loops, conditionals, and other control structures to implement
  [control flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)
- Demonstrate usage of data structures to model resources.

## Requirements

Create a single-player blackjack game that plays against the house, i.e., a
human player and computer dealer. You are free to create the user interface
however you want.

General Rules:

- [ ] The game should be played with a standard deck of playing cards (52).
- [ ] The house should be dealt two cards, hidden from the player until the
      house reveals its hand.
- [ ] The player should be dealt two cards, visible to the player.
- [ ] The player should have a chance to hit (i.e. be dealt another card) until
      they decide to stop or they _bust_ (i.e. their total is over 21). At which
      point they lose regardless of the dealer's hand.
- [ ] When the player stands, the house reveals its hand and hits (i.e. draw
      cards) until they have 17 or more.
- [ ] If dealer goes over 21 the dealer loses.

- [ ] The player should have two choices: "Hit" and "Stand."
- [ ] Consider Aces to be worth 11, never 1.
- [ ] The app should display the winner. For this mode, the winner is who is
      closer to a blackjack (21) without going over.
- [ ] There should be an option to play again; this should reset the hands and
      reshuffle the deck.
